The large effort required to create a functional, working product, wouldn't
have been possible without careful planning. The project management of WHCS is
paramount to our success as a team. We needed to be able to estimate our costs,
discover parts for our design, and make sure we kept on track of our timeline.
Planning these aspects of our project before hand created a well defined
roadmap that all group members could follow. Without such planning, everyone
would have had their own perception of time and responsibility and the project
would've floundered.

\subsection{Budget}
To help discover the costs of WHCS before diving straight in to the project, we
planned a comprehensive budget. This budget contained names, quantities, and
estimated costs of all the major parts of our project. This itemized breakdown
of WHCS allowed us to budget our funds amongst the group members and also to
apply for external funding. Through the use of our detailed budget, we were
able to land a funding offer of \$434.42 from Boeing. This covered
all WHCS expenses except for a few items bought by the members themselves.
Beyond this funding offer, the group members stated that they
were to provide up to \$300 each.

The costs listed in \autoref{tab:budget} are derived from costs researched
online. These are the best estimate at the time of creation for each item. Some
items are special in that the costs are dependent on other factors, such as
size. This items have a note specifying the method used to come to the final
price. This is important to note for auditors and for our future purchasing.

\caption{a comprehensive break down of WHCS' budget}
\label{tab:budget}
\end{table}

Naturally making a completely correct budget that covers every possible expense
was difficult and time consuming. There will always be items and purchases made
that are below, above, or not even on the list. With sufficiently complex
projects this is to be expected, but will not be a problem. The individual
money offered to support the group will cover any additional, unplanned
expenses.

In order to keep track of what was reimbursed versus what was purchased by
group members, all receipts were kept for the record. Any purchases made were
documented and a running sum of used funds were maintained. This kept
our purchases within the range of the budget and prevent large, unexpected
costs from surprising group members.

\subsection{Parts Acquisition}
In order to fulfill WHCS's Bill of Materials, we identified
manufacturers, retailers, and any other online and offline resources for
purchasing. Initial research gave the beginning insight in to where to look for
specific products. This was considered early on in order to consolidate
purchases, which simplified shipping and ultimately saved on cost. Some items
were special enough to warrant their purchase from a ``one-off'' retailer, such as the
electronic strike.

For all of our bulk electronic parts, we purchased from Digikey.
Digikey was familiar to us as engineers and
their interface for purchasing is straight forward. Additionally they shipped from
the United States, which ensured that we got our parts in a timely manner.
Shipping parts from China may have been cheaper overall, but the cost would have returned in
time lost to waiting for their arrival. To avoid this we didn't purchase
anything from overseas, except for the NRFs, which we bought very early.

\subsection{Milestones}
The WHCS project had a limited amount of time to complete its end goal of
having a working system. When thought of all at once, this seemed like an
insurmountable task. To simplify this large problem, broke up the task
in to smaller, more achievable, milestones. These milestones gave us a target
window for completion and also the interdependencies between milestones. For
instance, if the PCB board for the base station was not finished, the next step
of sending it off for manufacturing would have been delayed with every day.
The gantt chat
shown in \autoref{fig:gantt-chart} was used to keep our project goals in check
with the reality that we had a final deadline.

\subsection{Project Conclusion}

Through extensive research, design, and implementation
WHCS was realized to meet all requirements set. The
Android application was architected successfully for simplistic 
interaction. All use cases were implemented in order
to provide the optimal experience. The base station was
fabricated according to specifications. It has proved it is
capable of managing all state of WHCS and acting as the
middleman between the user and the home. The individual
control modules do the tasks that they were created for so
that the home can be controlled by the push of a button.
Future work includes extending the number and type of
control modules supported by WHCS.
