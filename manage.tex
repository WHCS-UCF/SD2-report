The large effort required to create a functional, working product, wouldn't
have been possible without careful planning. The project management of WHCS is
paramount to our success as a team. We need to be able to estimate our costs,
discover parts for our design, and make sure we keep on track of our timeline.
Planning these aspects of our project before hand creates a well defined
roadmap that all group members can follow. Without such planning, everyone
would have their own perception of time and responsibility and the project
would flounder.

\subsection{Budget}
To help discover the costs of WHCS before diving straight in to the project, we
planned a comprehensive budget. This budget contained names, quantities, and
estimated costs of all the major parts of our project. This itemized breakdown
of WHCS allowed us to budget our funds amongst the group members and also to
apply for external funding. Through the use of our detailed budget, we were
able to land a funding offer of \$434.42 from Boeing. This doesn't cover all
costs of the WHCS project, but takes a lot of financial burden off of the group
members. Beyond this funding offer, the group members have stated that they are
willing to provide up to \$300 each.

The costs listed in \autoref{tab:budget} are derived from costs researched
online. These are the best estimate at the time of creation for each item. Some
items are special in that the costs are dependent on other factors, such as
size. This items have a note specifying the method used to come to the final
price. This is important to note for auditors and for our future purchasing.

\caption{a comprehensive break down of WHCS' budget}
\label{tab:budget}
\end{table}

Naturally making a completely correct budget that covers every possible expense
would be difficult and time consuming. There will be items and purchases made
that are below, above, or not even on the list. With sufficiently complex
projects this is to be expected, but will not be a problem. The individual
money offered to support the group will cover any additional, unplanned
expenses.

In order to keep track of what was reimbursed versus what was purchased by
group members, all receipts will be kept for record. Any purchases made will be
documented and a running sum of used funds will be maintained. This will keep
the purchases within the range of the budget and prevent large, unexpected
costs from surprising group members.

\subsection{Parts Acquisition}
In order to fulfill WHCS's Bill of Materials, we will need to identify
manufacturers, retailers, and any other online and offline resources for
purchasing. Initial research gave the beginning insight in to where to look for
specific products. This should be considered early on in order to consolidate
purchases, which will simplify shipping and ultimately save on cost. Some items
may be special enough to warrant their purchase from a ``one-off'' retailer.
The electronic strike falls in to this category due to its specialty nature.

For all of our bulk electronic parts, we will be purchasing them from Digikey
or Mouser, depending on the price. Digikey is familar to us as engineers and
their interface for purchasing is straight forward. Additionally they ship from
the United States, which will ensure that we get our parts in a timely manner.
Shipping parts from China may be cheaper overall, but the cost is higher in the
time lost to waiting for their arrival. To avoid this debt, purchases from
overseas will be made a early as possible. That way we will not be blocked in
our design by waiting for parts.

\subsection{Milestones}
The WHCS project has a limited amount of time to complete its end goal of
having a working system. When thought of all at once, this seems like an
insurmountable task. To simplify this large problem, we have broken up the task
in to smaller, more achievable, milestones. This milestones give us a target
window for completion and also the interdependencies between milestones. For
instance, if the PCB board for the base station is not finished, the next step
of sending it off for manufactoring will be delayed with every day. This will
push every dependent milestone back causing a project delay. The gantt chat
shown in \autoref{fig:gantt-chart} is used to keep our project goals in check
with the reality that we a final deadline.
