Wireless Home Control System (WHCS) is a solution for any homeowner to
be able to remotely control core appliances of their home. WHCS
allows the user to control lights, outlets, doors, and sensors around their
home. The system{}'s design philosophy emphasizes ease of use, affordability,
and effectiveness. An Android phone application developed for WHCS allows
users to monitor the state of the installed components and activate them
remotely. A central base station equipped with a touch{}-enabled LCD is
present, allowing the users to interact with the system without the need of a
phone. Peripheral control modules may be installed into targeted
appliances such as lights, outlets, and doors for WHCS to control.

The implementation of such a system required research in a myriad of fields to
produce a full{}-fledged product. A well designed Android application is the key to
creating a positive first impression of WHCS. Thus, care was taken to
conform to the design philosophies of the Android ecosystem. The alternative
interface offered for WHCS is the base station{}'s display. Communication
devices form the foundation for the wireless aspect of WHCS, thus an
investigation into the advantages of different communication modules was
required to realize the system. A network protocol has been developed
and implemented in order to form a unified system from the independent modules.
The activation of appliances around the home requires high voltage control, so
methodologies for properly harnessing the power provided by homes were researched.
To extend upon harnessing the home{}'s power, our individual
control modules and base station{}'s logic level voltages (5V) depend upon the
creation of an efficient way to step down the high voltage supplied from the
home.

Wireless Home Control System is a solution targeting the masses and designed by
few. Naturally such a system suffers from the constraints imposed upon the
creators. Most prominent of all constraints are those stemming from economics.
The development and production of WHCS must conform to the low budget
available. Design decisions were made to minimize overall cost of the system
to satisfy this constraint. WHCS has the potential for mass implementation if
user reception is positive, therefore the design adheres to manufacturing
constraints. The parts used in the system have been chosen so that they are
widely available. Our boards and parts have been designed so that they are easy
to replicate and manufacture. With a product such as WHCS health and safety is
clearly an issue. The system is meant to be installed inside the home where the
user will feel at ease with the system installed. Thus it is ethical for us to
put effort into making the system safe to use. Things such as controlling the
home{}'s high voltage must be done in a safe manner.
